##
## This automation was created to be used with MACOS based on the instructions from drduh
## (https://github.com/drduh/YubiKey-Guide)
##
## The script was tested on an M1 with gpgtools 2020.2
##
## Pre requisites:
## * gpgtools: https://gpgtools.org
## * brew install ykman expect
##
## If you need to rerun this script you may want to reset gpg on the yubi with:
## ykman openpgp reset
## also you may want to remove these files:
## rm /tmp/key.txt
## rm ~/.zshrc  (carefull with this one... if you use it just delete the gpg related stuff)
## rm ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf
## rm ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf    
## rm ~/.gnupg/scdaemon.conf    
##

#variables definition
#you may change this variables as you wish
